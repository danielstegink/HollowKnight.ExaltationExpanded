# Exaltation Expanded
A supplement to the Exaltation mod created by Xhuis (and ported/updated by Théodore). 

This mod adds exaltations to the remaining charms as well as a handful of balance patches. The patches can be toggled via the menu.

Details on each exaltation can be found in the SPOILERS file and info on the various patches can be found in the PATCH SPOILERS file.

The patch notes can be found in the UPDATE HISTORY file.

## Thanks
Thank you to Xhuis, Théodore and everyone else who made Exaltation; it is an incredibly creative addition to the game and I would have never thought to create it.

Huge shout out to the Hollow Knight modding community as a whole. This was an especially intensive project and I was lost on multiple occasions without their help.
