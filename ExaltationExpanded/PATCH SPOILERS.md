# Patch List
This file contains a list of all special patches offered.

## External Mods
Pale Court compatibility patch currently only makes it so that unlocking King's Honour and glorifying Defender's Crest creates a more powerful version called King's Majesty.

## Internal
Nailsage's Glory nakes it possible to unlock both Nailsage's Tenacity and Nailsage's Patience as separate charms by defeating Nailsage Sly on radiant difficulty.

Balance Patch modifies Steel Tempest, Swift Focus and Primal Womb to feel less overwhelmingly powerful compared to the other glorifications.

Cost Patch fixes cost code for Lifeseed Lantern, Garden Sprig, Ambrosial Ampoule and Stagway Coin.
