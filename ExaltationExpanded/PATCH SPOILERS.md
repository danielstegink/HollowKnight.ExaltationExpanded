## Exaltation Balance
Power Patch modifies Steel Tempest, Swift Focus and Primal Womb to feel less overwhelmingly powerful compared to the other glorifications.

Cost Patch fixes cost code for Lifeseed Lantern, Garden Sprig, Ambrosial Ampoule and Stagway Coin.

## Swappable Charms
Nailsage's Glory allows you to unlock both Nailsage's Tenacity and Nailsage's Patience as separate charms by defeating Nailsage Sly on radiant difficulty.
