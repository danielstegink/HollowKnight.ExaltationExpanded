# Patch List

This file contains a list of all special patches offered.

## Pale Court
![Defender's Crest](https://github.com/danielstegink/HollowKnight.ExaltationExpanded/blob/master/Resources/10_P_.png?raw=true)

Compatibility patch with Pale Court. Currently only makes it so that unlocking King's Honour and glorifying Defender's Crest creates a more powerful version called King's Majesty.

## Nailsage's Glory
Makes it possible to unlock both Nailsage's Tenacity and Nailsage's Patience as separate charms by defeating Nailsage Sly on radiant difficulty.

## Balance Patch
Modifies Steel Tempest, Swift Focus and Primal Womb to feel less overwhelmingly powerful compared to the other glorifications.

## Cost Patch
Bug fix so that Lifeseed Lantern, Garden Sprig, Ambrosial Ampoule and Stagway Coin all have their intended costs.
